                When a community practices sustainable living, they help the environmental quality. Maintaining a sustainable lifestyle helps reduce your carbon footprint. When a community pursues sustainability, air pollution reduces. Clean air is key to a healthy community.

                It would be an understatement to say we talk a lot about sustainable living here on Sustainable Jungle! 

But what does that phrase actually mean?

Sustainable living is a practical philosophy that aims to reduce personal and societal environmental impact by making positive changes which counteract climate change and other negative environmental concerns.

More simply, sustainable living is a method of reducing one’s “carbon footprint”. If you need motivation to jump on board, try out the World Wildlife Fund’s environmental footprint calculator. 

“Sustainable living” encourages people to minimize their use of Earth’s resources and reduce the damage of human and environmental interactions.

Let’s first look at the more complex ethos behind sustainable living, before moving on to the practical side of sustainable living and how you can start.

                In more complex terms, sustainable living aims to achieve an environmental equilibrium. This is sometimes called “net zero living” or striking a “zero energy balance” with the Earth.

In other words, return to the earth whatever you take from it. 

Obviously, this is sustainability in its ideal form.

None of us will ever be able to truly achieve zero environmental impact. Which is why sustainability in its most broad sense also refers to how achievable that end is.  

This is somewhat explained by the three pillars of sustainability illustrated by the venn diagram above from Penn State University. On the outside, we have the big three components: environmental, social, and economic.

All three are connected by their subcircles and converging in the center of it all is true sustainability.

We can’t have one without the others. 

While environmental sustainability is first and foremost what we’re discussing, it’s important to bear in mind that without the economic and societal means it is vulnerable to collapse.
